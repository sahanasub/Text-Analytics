The feet pose particular problems since they cannot be covered with insulation in the form of feathers or blubber yet have a wide surface area. Two mechanisms are at work. First, the penguin can control the rate of blood flow to the feet by varying the diameter of arterial vessels supplying the blood. In cold conditions the flow is reduced when it is warm the flow increases. \nHowever, penguins also have countercurrent heat exchangers at the top of the legs. Arteries supplying warm blood to the feet break up into many small vessels that are closely allied to similar numbers of venous vessels bringing cold blood back from the feet. Heat flows from the warm blood to the cold blood. This way penguin feet are held a degree or two above freezing—to minimise heat loss while avoiding frostbite. \nFollow @jasperdoest for more images of the wonders of nature and the human-wildlife relationship. #onassignment @natgeoexpeditions #penguin #feet #bird #winter'","['Flightless bird', 'Gentoo penguin', 'Feather', 'Penguin', 'Bird', 'Emperor penguin', 'Leg', 'Fur', 'Beak', 'Claw']"

Despite the overall disappointment and distrust toward state authority that's prevalent among people living in the war zone, many see voting as a chance to change the situation. \nThe war-torn Donetsk and Lugansk regions were among those that cast the most votes for the current president of Ukraine–comedian Vladimir Zelensky—earlier this year. They also had the lowest levels of support for then incumbent Petro Poroshenko, who is perceived here as the president of war. \nIn the recent parliamentary elections, the two regions changed their preferences and voted for Opposition Platform–For Life, a party representing former Yanukovych elites. Its leader, Viktor Medvedchuk, is a friend of the Russian president Vladimir Putin. This is partly due to traditional support for pro-Russian politicians in this part of the country, which borders Russia. But another reason for the outcome is that only this party–notorious as it may be–suggested a concrete step to relieve the infrastructure paralysis: namely, to resume railway service to Donetsk and Lugansk. The remaining 21 parties, including Zelensky’s Servant of the People, confined themselves to abstract promises about restoring peace–words that nobody here takes seriously anymore.

No other crop produces the same amount of vegetable oil per acre that oil palm does."" However, while ""the productivity of well-maintained oil palm is amazing, the key issues now are the sustainable management of palm oil plantations, monocropping with heavy reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and expansion of plantations into pristine forest areas. High-quality forests are cut down for a one-off profit, which then eases the leasing of a clear-cut area for oil palm plantations. The key is to use already degraded land or land that aren’t primary forest or healthy secondary forest for these plantations as well as making sure that the supply chain is kept sustainable.""

When the tide retreats, the land is left more saline than before—and less able to grow crops. The same goes for the brackish creeks and river mouths dotting the forests. The second consequence: more big cyclones. Higher seas give the cyclone winds greater velocity, and the area has been hit by catastrophic cyclones in the previous years. #Climatechange #RoyalBengalTiger""","['Sky', 'Nature', 'Water', 'Green', 'Natural landscape', 'Cloud', 'Horizon', 'Sea', 'Sound', 'Water resources']"

There was already a bridge at this site for cars and trucks to cross over a canal. By adding ledges to the sides of the canal (where TNC Conservation Projects Manager Wendy Mathews walks third photo) and high fencing on either side of the bridge, conservationists were able to encourage panthers to cross beneath the road rather than through traffic above.

Young hyenas are called cubs, and female hyenas are wonderful moms. They take excellent care of their babies, and most hyenas provide their cubs with milk for over one year. This is probably a necessity, as many kills are made far from the den, and hyenas do not bring back food and regurgitate it for their young. At about one year, cubs begin to follow their mothers on their hunting and scavenging forays. Until then, they are left behind at the den with a babysitting adult.

Take a moment and think back to your childhood, the era in your life when the only thing you knew about a bill was that it was a bird’s equivalent of lips, and your day job was to construct fantastical worlds with your favorite toys. In my Toy Stories series, I explore the connection between children and their toys, getting an insight into their tiny worlds and taking you on a trip down memory lane. Toy Stories is the result of a 30-month trip, in which I visited more than 50 countries and took photographs of children and their favorite toys. I would often take part in a child’s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph. Despite some differences, I found similarities among children living worlds apart. Even in different countries, some children’s toys had the same function for example, protecting them from dangers and things they feared in the night. Toys haven’t changed all that much since I was a kid. I’d often find the kind of toys I used to have.

Back in the day, it used to be a way to show off your daughter to possible suitors. Things are starting to change for girls in the community. Yessy finished school and went on to college, and in this way she became a role model for many of her younger cousins. #mocache #montubiopride'","['Dress', 'Pink', 'Lady', 'Clothing', 'Beauty', 'Gown', 'Skin', 'Shoulder', 'Bride', 'Wedding dress']"

Many scientifically important fossils have been found here, including the world’s first identified T. rex, in 1902. In the United States, fossils found on private property usually belong to the landowner, and collectors may strike deals with owners to dig on their land.

However, since 2015 a team of Afghan female mountaineers—led by @afghan_ascend, a nonprofit developing young women into leaders through community service and the sport of mountain climbing—has been defying cultural boundaries and  challenging the gender stereotypes of Afghan society. Often, when these women climb outdoors, local boys will throw stones at them, and many of them have been threatened by their own family members for participating in the sport. \nIn 2018 Ascend’s team attempted the unthinkable: to climb and summit the highest peak in Afghanistan, Mount Noshaq (24,580 feet), which had never been climbed by an Afghan woman. Hanifa, shown in the following photos, became her nation’s first woman to complete the historic feat. Says Hanifa: “I did this for every Afghan woman.” These images are part of the feature- length documentary film ""An Uphill Battle,"" set to release in 2021. #girlsarealsostrong #Afghangirls #getoutside #forceofnature #sheexplores\n\nNat Geo is celebrating women who fearlessly push boundaries and inspire the next generation of changemakers.

Every day girls face barriers to education caused by poverty, cultural norms and practices, poor infrastructure, violence, and fragility. But girls’ education goes beyond getting girls into school. It is also about ensuring that girls learn and feel safe while in school so they can complete all levels of education with the skills to effectively compete in the labor market. They must also learn the social-emotional and life skills necessary to navigate and adapt to a changing world make decisions about their own lives and contribute to their communities and the world.

There are many. While we try not to anthropomorphize animals, there are individuals whose determination, dedication, and apparent kindness—even in the face of dire circumstances—speak volumes. One such female is a lioness in the Okavango known as Fekeetsa, a name that translates to ""overpower"" or ""overcome"" because of the odds that she faced. \nPerhaps she resonates particularly with me because I spent so much time with her after Dereck Joubert and I had been badly injured by a buffalo. We learnt her story after months of our own recovery and my close call with death. Fekeetsa was left with a broken wrist after a buffalo hunt went wrong. It should have been a death sentence, but she had young cubs to feed and she wasn\'t going to give up on them. \nDespite undeniable pain, she changed her hunting strategy and searched the swamps for baby lechwe hidden in the reeds so she wouldn\'t have to chase them. Every day she went out with the excruciating injury, and every day she brought food back for her cubs, who grew stronger and bigger. Gradually she began to heal, although she will always limp. At the beginning of this year she even adopted a cub that had strayed from its own pride and gotten lost—a phenomenon that is unheard of among lions. \nToday Fekeetsa\'s cubs are nearing her size and she has recovered enough to broaden her hunts again. She has shown a spirit that I have seen in many women over the years—a knowledge that the responsibility lies with her and the complete refusal to accept failure.\n#Fekeetsa #ThisismyTrophy\n\nNat Geo is celebrating women who fearlessly push boundaries and inspire the next generation of changemakers.

Driving her huge combine across her fields on the Dee River Ranch in Alabama, she gets to see the rewards coming back from a year of hard work. She watches a computer screen in the cab to see real-time yield data that shows how much corn she is harvesting—square foot by square foot—across her fields. That tells her how well she is doing at improving her soil by reducing erosion, encouraging earthworms, increasing water-holding capacity, and building soil organic matter. These things work together to help take carbon out of the atmosphere and sequester it in the soil. It’s all part of Annie’s life as a farmer. // @IndigoAg is unlocking agriculture’s potential to help reverse climate change.

Who doesn’t know the mythical stories about these large birds bringing babies to new parents? In Ancient Egypt, the stork was associated with the soul. Greek and Roman mythology portrays storks as models of parental devotion. In Chinese wisdom, the stork is a symbol of longevity. In Christianity, the stork is linked with purification, and followers of Islam revered storks because they made an annual ""pilgrimage"" through Mecca on their migration. \nHowever, since the mid-1980s, increasing numbers of white storks have chosen to stay on the European continent all year, rather than migrate to Africa in winter. The reason:  the guaranteed, abundant food supply from landfill sites, like this one in Portugal. While it is clear that the stork population has benefited from the large quantities of food, you don’t have to be a scientist to see something is wrong.\nConfronting the enormous amount of waste we produce on a daily basis is truly horrifying. Walking through fields of empty bottles, plastic bags, food leftovers, and toys brings me to tears. I\'m embarrassed to be part of our consumer society. We have to turn the tide.

Prior to the war, both women used to live in a family house in the suburban village of Opytne, between Donetsk and Avdeevka, in eastern Ukraine. They had to flee when their street became a front line—a powerful explosion buried Lira alive under the wreckage. Altogether the house got three direct artillery hits.\nNow they live in Tatiana’s daughter’s apartment in Avdeevka. This apartment was also damaged by shelling and repaired by the women on their own. “My daughter has a real talent! She has fixed it so nicely you could never tell there was a huge hole in this wall,” she proudly tells us. Her husband, Aleksander, chose to rebel against the war’s indignity in his own way: like many people in eastern Ukraine, he refuses to leave his demolished house. He continues living in the basement–the only surviving part–and cultivates the garden. Every day he takes a bike ride through the minefield that separates Opytnoe from Avdeevka to visit his wife. Tatiana prepares him a meal to take back, as he has no kitchen left in the ruins.\nTatiana lost a court hearing over compensation for her house. She felt humiliated by the attitude of the hearing members: “They would ask me questions like, why do I think that my house was shelled? Then they turned to a witness and began interrogating her about what brand of refrigerator I had and how many burners there were on the gas stove. They were talking to us like they assumed we were lying and it was their job to catch us out.” Ukraine’s official position is that Russia is to blame for the war, and so all claims should be addressed across the border. \nWords by Alisa Sopova, from the series #5Kfromthefrontline, an ongoing project about the everyday consequences of the war in eastern Ukraine.'","['Eating', 'Human', 'Food', 'Meal', 'Dish', 'Child', 'Comfort food', 'Conversation', 'Cuisine']"

What was interesting was what Adam was doing for the soil beneath his feet—and by extension for the atmosphere. Adam plants cover crops (you can see their residue between the cotton rows) that do a host of good things like fixing nitrogen, building root structure, reducing soil erosion, and building soil carbon by taking carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it in the soil. Adam uses no-till farming—he doesn’t plow, for example—and rotates crops, all of which is good for soil building. Agriculture is a big player in the environment. If done on a global scale, good farming practices can be a powerful tool in fighting climate change. // @IndigoAg is unlocking agriculture’s potential to help reverse climate change. That’s the vision behind the Terraton Initiative, a global movement with the goal of using regenerative farming practices to take one trillion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

A flexible cartilage connects the spine to the ribs, which means the rib cage collapses under heavy pressure instead of snapping. These whales were historically hunted for their oil and spermaceti, a mixture of fat and waxes found in their heads. Spermaceti was used to make candles and cosmetics, among other things.

You could be a wildlife photographer for twenty years and never be prepared for what it\'s like to walk up to a dying sea otter, wheezing its last breaths. Beginning in 2013, a body of warm water, nicknamed ""the blob,"" formed in the Gulf of Alaska. It morphed and it grew and it stretched all the way to Mexico, until it covered 3.5 million square miles, feeding toxic algae blooms that devastated marine life on the North Pacific coast for years. In 2015, some 300 sea otters were found dead or dying on beaches in Homer, Alaska. I will never forget the sounds they made. Warming water temperatures worldwide are a symptom of the climate crisis—the blob was like a fever. The American government recently announced that it intends to change the Endangered Species Act, making it easier to remove endangered species, like the sea otter, from the list. It also pits the value of protecting species up against the cost of losing revenue from industry. Research tells us that extreme events like the blob will become more common if we continue to put industry and profit first, things will only get worse.

Take a moment and think back to your childhood, the era in your life when the only thing you knew about a bill was that it was a bird’s equivalent of lips, and your day job was to construct fantastical worlds with your favorite toys. In my Toy Stories series, I explore the connection between children and their toys, getting an insight into their tiny worlds and taking you on a trip down memory lane. Toy Stories is the result of a 30-month trip in which I visited more than 50 countries and took photographs of children and their favorite toys. I would often take part in a child’s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph. Despite some differences, I found similarities among children living worlds apart. Even in different countries, some children’s toys had the same function for example, protecting them from dangers and things they feared in the night. Toys haven’t changed all that much since I was a kid. I’d often find the kind of toys I used to have.

Thawing permafrost is undermining riverfront houses and making the landscape harder to navigate. It is also causing ice cellars (homemade freezers dug into permafrost) to flood and food to spoil. Over centuries people and communities in the Arctic have used ice cellars to safely store fish and meat that will feed them through the long winters ahead. Permafrost thaw is seriously challenging this practice, and as a result, changing the way of life for people from Siberia to Alaska. Soon, the rest of the planet may also feel the impact. Scientists have recently confirmed that permafrost is thawing much faster than expected, releasing carbon gases that could drastically speed up climate change.'","['Wilderness', 'Water resources', 'Water', 'River', 'Sky', 'Lake', 'Reservoir', 'Recreation', 'Tourism', 'Bank']"

The railroads had come in 1903 and taken over the mail contracts, and that was the end of the stagecoach. ""I used to drive a six-horse stage for the round trip to Benson and back took about twelve hours counting time to change horses,"" he told me.\nAfter the stagecoach stopped, Sid was a rodeo cowboy, a big game hunting guide, and gathered wild horses in Arizona and New Mexico.

The fact that scientists will create billion-dollar instruments in this sandbox made me reflect on the obvious connection between creativity, science, and play.

Baleen whales like these humpbacks, which I photographed feeding off the coast of British Columbia, do not have teeth they have baleen plates, a filter-feeding system that allows baleen whales to filter their food, usually small fish or krill, by swimming for their prey with their mouths wide open. Water passes through the baleen, but small prey like krill and herring and salmon are caught in the bristles, and then swallowed whole. Baleen whales have narrow throats and do not usually eat larger prey like squids or octopus.

Visit the link in my bio or nationalgeographic.com/animals to learn how new toll roads could block the panther’s path to recovery. I’ve been covering the story of the Florida panther for the past three years using custom-made camera traps through my Path of the Panther project with @insidenatgeo. The Florida panther is the last subpopulation of pumas surviving in the eastern United States. It has persevered because of its ability to live in the hurricane-battered swamps of the southern Everglades, where as few as 20 panthers survived the hunting and persecution that eliminated pumas everywhere east of the Mississippi River. It’s from these Everglades swamps that the panther has staged its recovery, and is beginning to reclaim its historic territory in the northern Everglades and beyond. Panthers need expansive territory. One panther's home range is up to 200 square miles—ten times the size of Manhattan. That makes the Florida panther an umbrella species, which means protecting habitat for one panther helps protect habitat for hundreds of other species. As shown in these photos, a Florida black bear, white egret, American alligator (with a giant salamander in its mouth), and coyote all share the same trails with the panther. To learn more about the different species, how these photos were made, and what happened when Hurricane Irma hit my camera traps a few days after this panther photo was captured, please visit @carltonward. We are following the story of the endangered Florida panther to inspire protection of the Florida Wildlife Corridor (@fl_wildcorridor). #floridawild #panther #KeepFLWild @ilcp_photographers @pathofthepanther #pathofthepanther.""","['Wildlife', 'Canidae', 'Tree', 'Biome', 'Nature reserve', 'Water', 'Dog', 'Carnivore', 'Forest', 'Adaptation']"
