Tapirs are South America’s largest land mammal and have existed since the Eocene era. They are known as the gardeners of the forest, responsible for shaping and maintaining biodiversity. They are herbivores, with roughly 50 percent of their diet consisting of fruit, and are also wide-ranging animals, traveling long distances across different habitats. So after they consume and digest their fruits, they spread seeds all over the forest. Today this crucial species is under threat from poaching and industrial agriculture that destroys tapir habitat, increases roadkill accidents, and spreads pesticides. \nI followed Patricia in the field this past May for @insidenatgeo, documenting her important work on the fascinating, vulnerable, and elusive tapir.'","['people', 'in', 'nature', 'grassland', 'natural', 'landscape', 'standing', 'grass', 'grass', 'family', 'ecoregion', 'sky', 'field', 'photography']",people in nature grassland natural landscape standing grass grass family ecoregion sky field photography,0.10338787143018022,0.02581239917031574,0.056842588074261534,0,"Photo by Katie Orlinsky @katieorlinsky | Conservation biologist Patricia Medici stands in the Pantanal of Brazil. Patricia is one of this year’s recipients of the National Geographic/Buffett Awards for Leadership and Conservation. She has dedicated 27 years to the conservation of lowland tapirs and their remaining habitats in Brazil as part of the Brazilian nonprofit Instituto de Pesquisas Ecológicas (Institute for Ecological Research). Tapirs are South America’s largest land mammal and have existed since the Eocene era. They are known as the gardeners of the forest, responsible for shaping and maintaining biodiversity. They are herbivores, with roughly 50 percent of their diet consisting of fruit, and are also wide-ranging animals, traveling long distances across different habitats. So after they consume and digest their fruits, they spread seeds all over the forest. Today this crucial species is under threat from poaching and industrial agriculture that destroys tapir habitat, increases roadkill accidents, and spreads pesticides. \nI followed Patricia in the field this past May for @insidenatgeo, documenting her important work on the fascinating, vulnerable, and elusive tapir.' people in nature grassland natural landscape standing grass grass family ecoregion sky field photography","['people', 'nature', 'grassland', 'natural', 'landscape', 'standing', 'grass', 'grass', 'family', 'ecoregion', 'sky', 'field', 'photography']",0.00833471305668354,0.008337661623954773,0.008334576152265072,0.008333476260304451,0.008340185508131981,0.9249740839004517,0.00833943672478199,0.008333658799529076,0.00833827629685402,0.008333954960107803

The properties on either side of the road are private ranches that have been protected by perpetual conservation easements, funded by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and other partners. There was already a bridge at this site for cars and trucks to cross over a canal. By adding ledges to the sides of the canal (where TNC Conservation Projects Manager Wendy Mathews walks third photo) and high fencing on either side of the bridge, conservationists were able to encourage panthers to cross beneath the road rather than through traffic above. Vehicles kill nearly 30 Florida panthers on roads each year—the leading cause of death for the endangered puma. With the pictured segment of the statewide Florida Wildlife Corridor secure, panthers and other wildlife can now move safely from large public lands up to the southern banks of the Caloosahatchee River and the northern Everglades beyond. The Caloosahatchee had been a long-standing barrier to the northward movement of female panthers until late 2016, when the first female panthers were detected on the north side of the river in nearly 50 years.

While we tried to manage the pressure of making the film and doing our best to shield Alex from the pressures of production, nothing compares to what Alex managed over those two years and particularly on June 3, 2017. We have all been incredibly grateful for the connection people have had with the film—there is truly no more a film team could ask for.

This young man and I were riding out on the colony’s land that spread out below the mountain ranges of central Montana. I remember what a beautiful late afternoon it had been, and how the clouds darkened as they momentarily obscured the sun and dramatically silhouetted the young horseman. That assignment was the beginning of a lifetime relationship with some of the Hutterites, who have become almost like a second family to me over the years. I’ve done articles for National Geographic about the Hutterites, one published in July 1970 and the other in the June 2006 issue.

Ground collapses at Duvanny Yar, a permafrost “megaslump” along the Kolyma River in northern Siberia. This constantly moving landslide, driven by erosion and sped up by warming temperatures, is an important research site for scientists, who use it to track what happens when carbon-rich land that has been hidden and frozen for centuries begins to thaw. Permafrost is a layer of continuously frozen soil found primarily in the Arctic. It covers almost 1/4 of the Earth’s surface.

Visit the link in my bio or nationalgeographic.com/animals to learn how new toll roads could block the panther’s path to recovery. I’ve been covering the story of the Florida panther for the past three years using custom-made camera traps through my Path of the Panther project with @insidenatgeo. The Florida panther is the last subpopulation of pumas surviving in the eastern United States. It has persevered because of its ability to live in the hurricane-battered swamps of the southern Everglades, where as few as 20 panthers survived the hunting and persecution that eliminated pumas everywhere east of the Mississippi River. It’s from these Everglades swamps that the panther has staged its recovery, and is beginning to reclaim its historic territory in the northern Everglades and beyond. Panthers need expansive territory. One panther's home range is up to 200 square miles—ten times the size of Manhattan. That makes the Florida panther an umbrella species, which means protecting habitat for one panther helps protect habitat for hundreds of other species. As shown in these photos, a Florida black bear, white egret, American alligator (with a giant salamander in its mouth), and coyote all share the same trails with the panther. To learn more about the different species, how these photos were made, and what happened when Hurricane Irma hit my camera traps a few days after this panther photo was captured, please visit @carltonward.
