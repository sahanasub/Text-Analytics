### Introduction
Today, the internet acts as a gathering place for users in the form of blogs, discussion forums and chat rooms, thereby generating massive amounts of data regarding the consumers' opinions, experiences and interactions. In this project, we explore the user-generated content from a car discussion forum - [Edmunds](https://forums.edmunds.com/) to analyze the consumers' preception of their car brand and the brand's competitors. We attempt to translate the user-generated content to market structure and competitive landscape insights.
